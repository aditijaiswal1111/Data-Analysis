# Analysis of Car Sales Dataset

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the "Car Sales" dataset focusing on car sales in the US. The objectives of this analysis include preliminary data cleaning, understanding the data's nature through statistical analyses, exploratory data analytics, drawing inferences, and forecasting. The outcomes of this lab exercise aim to provide insights for manufacturers, consumers, and stakeholders in the automotive industry.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about car sales in the US, including various features such as manufacturer, model, price, sales figures, and other relevant attributes.

## Objectives
### Major Objectives:
1. **Market Trend Analysis**: Predicting market trends to guide manufacturers on investing in car models that maximize sales.
2. **Consumer Guidance**: Categorizing cars into price segments and providing recommendations to consumers based on desired features and high resale value.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Distribution of features: Descriptive statistics, box plots, and frequency plots.
- Identification of outliers and their impact on sales.
- Discovering natural clusters in the data.

### Relationship Analysis:
- Relationship between sales and other features.
- Identification of manufacturers and models with highest/lowest sales.
